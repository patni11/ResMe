/**
 * Note: ResumePDF is supposed to be rendered inside PDFViewer. However,
 * PDFViewer is rendered too slow and has noticeable delay as you enter
 * the resume form, so we render it without PDFViewer to make it render
 * instantly. There are 2 drawbacks with this approach:
 * 1. Not everything works out of box if not rendered inside PDFViewer,
 *    e.g. svg doesn't work, so it takes in a isPDF flag that maps react
 *    pdf element to the correct dom element.
 * 2. It throws a lot of errors in console log, e.g. "<VIEW /> is using incorrect
 *    casing. Use PascalCase for React components, or lowercase for HTML elements."
 *    in development, causing a lot of noises. We can possibly workaround this by
 *    mapping every react pdf element to a dom element, but for now, we simply
 *    suppress these messages in <SuppressResumePDFErrorMessage />.
